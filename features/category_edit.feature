Feature: Create and edit Categories
  As a blog administrator
  In order to group articles
  I want to create and edit categories

  Background:
    Given the blog is set up
    And I am logged into the admin panel

  Scenario: Successfully edit categoties
    Given I am on the new category page
    #When I fill in "article_title" with "Foobar"
    #And I fill in "article__body_and_extended_editor" with "Lorem Ipsum"
    #And I press "Publish"
    #Then I should be on the admin content page
    #When I go to the home page
    #Then I should see "Foobar"
    #When I follow "Foobar"
    #Then I should see "Lorem Ipsum"
